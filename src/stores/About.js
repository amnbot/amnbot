	"Hello! My name is Aymen Ouali and I am a second year Software Engineering student currently enrolled at McGill University. I've always been interested in what comes into making games, applications and all sorts of things, which naturally led me to game development in Unity in 2019. Since then, I have worked with multiple coding languages. I love learning new things and working with new frameworks, which is why I try to vary the technologies I work with as much as I can."
