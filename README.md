## 👨‍💻 About me
Hello! 👋

I am Aymen Ouali, a third year Software Engineering student at McGill University. I've always been interested in what comes into making video games, applications and all sorts of things, which naturally led me to game development in Unity in 2019. Since then, I have worked with multiple coding languages. I love learning new things and working with new frameworks, which is why I try to vary the technologies I work with as much as I can.

## 🖥️ My Projects

### 🏫 [Classroom AIssistant - ConUHacks](https://github.com/amnbot/CONUHACKS)
With the lack of elementary school teachers in Quebec right now, we wanted to provide a product which makes the teaching experience easier. Our product allows for teachers to focus better on the teaching aspect, and helps identify which students might be struggling to pay attention in class.

### 📑 [Quizzler - Codejam 13 | ⭐Best Educational Hack](https://github.com/amnbot/CodeJam13)
Quizzler enhances students' studying experience to dynamically generate AI exams from their lecture notes, allowing them to easily review lecture material and track their learning over time.

### 📖 [Infinite Piece - MAIS Hacks 2023 | ⭐Honourable Mention](https://github.com/amnbot/infinite-piece)
Visual novels using have very limiting choice. We wanted to make one where the story can take any possible turn and the only limit is the user's creativity.

### 🛂 [CrowdSpace - McHacks 10](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE223-Winter2022/group-project--21)
CrowdSpace is a web app that allows event staff to localize potentially dangerous zones using a heatamp to analyze the crowd's density, communicate with their team and act as fast as possible.

### 📖 [StudyGroup - CodeJam 12 | 🥉3rd Place](https://github.com/laheau/studygroup)
StudyGroup is an all in one platform to enhance your studying experience by creating a hub for knowledge. It simplifies collaboration, note-taking, and tracking your progression - using study cards. It includes study groups, collaboration and discussion forums, where questions can be converted into flashcards, as well as a quizzing system.

### 🧍‍♂️ [POZZ](https://github.com/amnbot/POZZ)
When working on computers, we tend to slouch after some amount of time without realizing it. For MAIS Hacks 2022, my team and I designed a deep learning model to detect whether or not the person in front of the camera is sitting correctly. If the posture is bad for a certain duration, the user is notified through SMS.

### 📺 [Anime Recommendation Website](https://github.com/amnbot/AnimeRecommenderServer)
An anime recommenation engine built using two recommendation methods: content based filtering and collaborative filtering.

### 👨‍💻 [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/amnbot/amnbot)
A website where I display all my projects, work experience and skills.

### 🎵 [NDL-K Arcade](https://github.com/amnbot/NDL-K)
As the name implies, this application is not a single game, but a bunch of games all in one place! All games are K-Pop related. Users can put their K-Pop related knowledge to the test by answering randomly generated questions. They can also play Save One Drop One, where they choose their favorite of two *randomly selected* (using a recommendation engine) K-Pop songs.

### 📝 [StoryHolic - CodeJam 11](https://github.com/amnbot/CodeJamXI)
Storyholic is a website that allows its users to create stories together. Each user can submit a scene to begin a new story, or to append to an existing one. Then, users may read stories submitted to the website as chains of different scenes, traversing through the many different possible paths submitted by our many users. To read through the stories and their different outcomes, go to the homepage and browse either by scene name or by tags. You will be able to create new branches for the story you decide to read. If you wish to create a new story, simply go to the create page and submit your very own original story!

### ⌨️ [Typing Speed Game](https://github.com/amnbot/TypingSpeedTest)
A team project submitted for SacHacks 2021! It is a simple speed typing game with random, challenging promps.

### 🔢 [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/amnbot/SudokuSolver)
A simple sudoku solver implemented using a recursive algorithm and PyGame for the user interface.

### 🕹️ [Anime Save One Drop One](https://github.com/amnbot/AnimeSaveOneDropOne)
A website created with Blazor WebAssembly that allows users to choose their favorite of two japanese animation characters. It was implemented using the Jikan API, an unofficial API for MyAnimeList.

### 📱[Slashy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NDLAMN.Slashy&pli=1)
A hyper-casual game made with Unity, available both on [itch.io](https://amnbot.itch.io/slashy) and on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NDLAMN.Slashy&pli=1)!

## 👨‍🎓 School Projects

### 📖 [StudyBuddy - ECSE 428](https://github.com/ECSE-428-Group-16)
A team project consisting of building a full-stack study app for making and sharing flashcards.

### 😄 [Character Mood Classifier - MAIS 202](https://github.com/amnbot/Mais202)
As part of the machine learning bootcamp at McGill, I built a deep learning model for classifying emotions of manga characters. Beginner artists sometimes struggle to convey their character's emotions. This tool helps these artists see if their drawings convey emotion properly by using Deep Learning.

### 🎨 [Museum Website - ECSE 324](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2022/project-group-1)
A team project consisting of building a full-stack website for a museum.

### 🌊 [Dive Safe App - ECSE 223](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE223-Winter2022/group-project--21)
A Java app for a diving system allowing visitors to book guides, equipment and hotels.
